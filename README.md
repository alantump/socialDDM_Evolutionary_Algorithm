# socialDDM_Evolutionary_Algorithm
Code for "The evolution of information integration  under social influence" by Alan Novaes Tump, Max Wolf and Ralf H.J.M. Kurvers; unpublished.


This reprository contains the following parts:

Emprical Data: `All_easy_rawdata2.csv`  

Code for run the Evolutionary Algorithm:
- Run the evolutionary algorithm `EA_simulations_cluster.R`.
- Diagnosis and plots are done with `EA_analys_cluster.R`, which also saves the results in LaTex tables.
- Further static analysis can be performed in `Static_analysis.R` 
- All other R files are used within the above mentioned code.

Subfolders with results:
- `\ServerResult` containing the saved results of the evolutionary algorithm
- `\final_plots` containing final figures for talks and paper
- `\EA_results` containing html files for visual inspection of the simuation.

If you have any questions or issues running the code, please do not hesitate to contact us via: tump@mpib-berlin.mpg.de
